Build: Nothing has to be built because it is in Python.


Run: The mancalaproject.py program can be run in idle or an editor that works with Python. Follow the program’s instructions for entering player 1 and player 2. The options for players are minimax, alphabeta, random, and human, and they should be typed as input with no capitals, spaces, or extra characters. If you are playing as a human player, enter the index of the pit(s) you would like to play during your turn as one integer from 0 to 5.
